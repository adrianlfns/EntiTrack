2. Prototype development and iteration  
3. Final delivery and client-style presentation

Your final output will include:
- A **functioning prototype**
- A **client-ready consulting deck**
- A **detailed public-facing README**
- A **well-organized GitHub repo**
- A **Microsoft Planner board**
- A **live presentation and demo**

## 🧩 Final Tips

- Keep your README clear, visual, and professional—this is a portfolio piece.
